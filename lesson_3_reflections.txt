When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would prefer using a remote repository if I am going to do simple changes in text files which do not affect my code directly. I think this would save me a lot of time.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This would give me flexibility to decide when I think I am ready to pull my changes from Remote or vice versa. Plus for staying up-to-date at all times it would be required that the repositories be connected at all times, which if does not happen might cause conflicts.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Clone : Basically copies the repository so that you can work on it as if it were your own.
Branches : Work on the same code base and later have the flexibility to merge your code with the same.
Fork : Use an existing repository on github to modify seaprately while still being connected to the parent repository. You have the liberty to suggest.
